# Changelog

All notable changes to `labapi` are documented here in release order.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
This changelog is written for package users and maintainers, so entries call
out user-visible behavior, supported runtime changes, and release-engineering
details that affect development workflows.

## 1.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added

- Support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 across package metadata, README/docs,
  GitHub issue templates, reusable CI matrices, `ruff`, and `ty`.
- `typing-extensions` as a runtime dependency so code can use backported typing
  helpers such as `Self`, `override`, and `Buffer` while supporting Python 3.10.
- Lazy environment-variable loading through `labapi.util.env.getenv()`. When
  `python-dotenv` is installed, `.env` is loaded on first credential lookup
  instead of during `labapi.client` import.
- Broader GitHub Actions coverage for normal pushes and pull requests, with
  reusable Python checks defaulting to Python 3.10 through 3.13.

### Changed

- Reworked entry factory fallback handling. Unknown upstream LabArchives part
  types now load as `UnknownEntry`, while recognized but unimplemented part
  types load as `UnimplementedEntry`; both still reject unsupported updates.
- Updated attachment cloning to use an explicit random-access capability check
  instead of requiring every file-like object to expose a reliable
  `seekable()` method.
- Kept spooled attachment buffers open after `Attachment.from_file()` returns,
  while still preserving the caller's original file cursor position.
- Refactored `MockClient` test support around XML builder helpers and
  `RecordedApiCall`, making fixture data less dependent on raw XML strings.
- Refreshed example setup instructions to use repository-root editable
  installs, documented the `dotenv`/`builtin-auth` extras, and normalized file
  path handling in the notebook logging example.
- Pinned the docs and publish workflows to a Python 3.10-compatible toolchain
  for the `1.1` release line.

### Fixed

- Improved `Attachment.from_file()` support for random-access binary streams
  that do not expose `seekable()`.
- Fixed dotenv cache handling in client initialization tests so tests can
  exercise missing-environment and `.env`-backfilled credential paths
  independently.

### Removed

- Removed absolute `datetime` expiration inputs from URL signing helpers. Pass
  a relative `timedelta` to `Client.construct_url()` or `_sign_url()` instead.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-04-24

### Added

- This changelog, including backfilled release notes for `1.0.0` through
  `1.0.3` and an unreleased `1.1.0` section.
- Zenodo DOI badge in the README, linking the package repository to its
  archived citation record (`#138`).

### Changed

- Switched the release workflow from TestPyPI to production PyPI publishing via
  `uv publish --trusted-publishing always` (`#139`).
- Updated the publish environment metadata and release URL from TestPyPI to the
  production PyPI project page (`#139`).
- Refreshed the lockfile for `lxml` 6.1.0 and `python-dotenv` 1.2.2 on the
  `1.0` maintenance branch.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- Refined the client auth flow and browser detection behavior.
- Simplified tree path handling.
- Switched the `1.0` type-check workflow from `mypy` to `ty`.
- Refreshed package metadata, README content, and Zenodo configuration.
- Updated `pillow` and `pytest`.

### Fixed

- Restored datetime-based URL signing support.
- Improved browser detection robustness when detectable values arrive with
  incorrect types.
- Fixed test compatibility issues in the `1.0` maintenance branch.
- Reduced tree creation complexity in the `v1.0.3` stabilization pass.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- Cleaned up the PyPI README and related package metadata.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Initial TestPyPI publishing workflow.
- GitHub issue templates.
- Reusable GitHub Actions checks and broader local tooling support.

### Changed

- Improved versioning and generated documentation metadata.
- Refreshed contributor and Sphinx configuration docs.
- Updated `cryptography`, `pygments`, and `requests`.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Initial stable release of `labapi`.
- Support for LabArchives authentication, notebook tree traversal, and
  page and entry operations from Python.
- Project documentation and example workflows for common notebook automation
  tasks.
