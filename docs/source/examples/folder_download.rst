Folder Structure Download
=========================

This example downloads a LabArchives notebook subtree to your local computer
while preserving its directory hierarchy. Pages become folders, and individual
entries are written out as separate files.

When to Use It
--------------

This is useful for:

- Creating local backups of your LabArchives notebooks.
- Exporting notebook content for offline viewing.
- Archiving completed projects.
- Migrating content to other systems.
- Version control integration for notebook content.

Requirements
------------

This example assumes the recommended local interactive profile,
``labapi[dotenv,builtin-auth]``. See :ref:`installation`.

No additional third-party packages are required.

Configuration
-------------

For the local interactive workflow, create a ``.env`` file in the repository
root:

.. code-block:: toml

   API_URL="https://api.labarchives.com"
   ACCESS_KEYID="your_access_key_id"
   ACCESS_PWD="your_password"

You can also provide the same values through shell environment variables. See
:ref:`first_calls` for both options.

Common Commands
---------------

Download an entire notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run python examples/folder_download/folder_download.py ./backup --notebook "My Notebook"

Download only a specific subtree:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run python examples/folder_download/folder_download.py ./2024_experiments --notebook "My Notebook" --path "Experiments/2024"

Overwrite an existing output directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run python examples/folder_download/folder_download.py ./backup --notebook "My Notebook" --overwrite

How It Works
------------

The script mirrors the LabArchives structure:

.. code-block:: text

   LabArchives Structure:          Local File Structure:

   My Notebook/                    output/
   |- Experiments/                 |- Experiments/
   |  |- Trial 1/  (page)          |  |- Trial 1/
   |  |  |- Header entry           |  |  |- 001_header.txt
   |  |  |- Text entry             |  |  |- 002_text.html
   |  |  `- Attachment             |  |  `- 003_attachment_image.png
   |  `- Trial 2/  (page)          |  `- Trial 2/
   |     `- Text entry             |     `- 001_text.html
   `- Data/  (directory)           `- Data/
      `- Results/  (page)             `- Results/
         `- Attachment                  `- 001_attachment_data.csv

File Naming Convention
----------------------

Downloaded entries follow this naming pattern:

.. code-block:: text

   001_header.txt          # First entry (header)
   002_text.html           # Second entry (rich text)
   003_attachment_data.csv # Third entry (attachment)
   003_caption.txt         # Caption for the attachment
   004_plaintext.txt       # Fourth entry (plain text)

- Entries are numbered in the order they appear on the page.
- Entry type is indicated in the filename.
- Attachments preserve their original filename.
- Captions are saved in separate ``*_caption.txt`` files.

Output Layout
-------------

Each downloaded location contains:

For pages:

- ``_metadata.txt`` with page information such as name, ID, and entry count.
- ``001_*``, ``002_*``, and similar files for each entry on the page.

For directories:

- Subdirectories for each child directory.
- Subdirectories for each page.

Notes
-----

- The script preserves the complete directory structure.
- Filenames are sanitized to be filesystem-safe.
- Widget entries are noted but cannot be fully exported because they are
  read-only.
- Large notebooks may take significant time to download.
- The script creates a ``_metadata.txt`` file for each page with additional
  information.

Ways to Extend It
-----------------

1. Add resume capability for interrupted downloads.
2. Verify downloaded files with checksums.
3. Create ZIP archives after export.
4. Filter by entry type or date range.
5. Add progress bars with ``tqdm``.
6. Implement incremental backups for only new or changed content.
7. Export metadata as JSON.
8. Write detailed logs during long downloads.
