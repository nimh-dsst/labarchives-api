Example Applications
====================

These runnable examples show end-to-end workflows built on top of the core
``labapi`` APIs. Start with :ref:`installation` if you still need to set up the
recommended local interactive profile.

     - Converting CSV data to LabArchives HTML tables and round-tripping back
       to CSV
     - ``beautifulsoup4``

Published Examples
------------------

- :doc:`json_sync` synchronizes JSON files between a local folder and a single
  LabArchives page.
- :doc:`folder_download` mirrors a notebook subtree to local files while
  preserving page and directory structure.
- :doc:`csv_table` uploads CSV data as HTML tables and downloads those tables
  back to CSV.

Getting Started
---------------

All published examples assume:

- Python 3.12+.
- The recommended local interactive profile:
  ``labapi[dotenv,builtin-auth]``.
- A repository-root working directory when you run ``uv run ...`` commands.
- Notebook-relative page paths paired with ``--notebook "My Notebook"``.

Use these sample commands as known-good starting points:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run python examples/json_sync/json_sync.py upload examples/json_sync/sample_data "Experiments/2024/Data Analysis" --notebook "My Notebook"
   uv run python examples/folder_download/folder_download.py ./backup --notebook "My Notebook" --path "Experiments/2024"
   uv run --with beautifulsoup4 python examples/csv_table/csv_table.py upload examples/csv_table/sample_data.csv "Experiments/Results" --notebook "My Notebook"

Additional Local Examples
-------------------------

The repository also includes ``examples/model_logging`` and
``examples/notebook_logging``. They are maintained alongside the published
examples above, but do not yet have dedicated Sphinx pages.
